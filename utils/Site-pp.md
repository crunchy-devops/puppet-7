In **Puppet 7**, the `site.pp` file is the **main entry point** for defining node configurations in a Puppet environment. It is located in the **Puppet manifest directory** (usually `/etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/manifests/site.pp`).  

### **Purpose of `site.pp`**
1. **Define Global Node Configurations**  
   - It applies configurations to all or specific nodes.  
2. **Include Classes and Modules**  
   - It loads other Puppet classes, modules, and roles.  
3. **Conditional Logic for Nodes**  
   - Assigns specific configurations to specific servers.  

### **Example `site.pp` File**
```puppet
# Apply to all nodes
node default {
  include base_config
}

# Specific node configuration
node 'webserver.example.com' {
  include apache
}

node 'dbserver.example.com' {'1
  include postgresql
}
```
### **Key Points**
âœ… **Centralized Configuration**: Acts as the **root manifest** for Puppet.  
âœ… **Flexibility**: Can use logic to assign different roles to different nodes.  
âœ… **Modular**: Encourages reusable class-based design.

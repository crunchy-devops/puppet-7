I've added version management to your Puppet provider. It now supports installing a specific version of a package and fetching the latest available version. Let me know if you need further enhancements! ðŸš€
Here is a **Puppet provider** for managing **Alpine Linux packages** using `apk`. This provider allows you to install, remove, and query packages on Alpine OS.

This **Puppet provider** allows you to manage Alpine Linux packages using `apk`. It supports:
- **Installation**: `apk add <package>`
- **Uninstallation**: `apk del <package>`
- **Update**: `apk update` before installing
- **Querying**: Checks if a package is installed

Would you like additional features, such as version management? ðŸš€
